Author: Oween Cesar Barranzuela Carrasco, Student Number = 2***3
This repository contains three small projects developed as part of our Programming 2 lecture. These projects were intended to help us improve our Python skills and are subject to mistakes.
## Projects Overview

    Connect Four
        Description: This project implements the famous Connect Four game. The game includes an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm to make decisions.
        Files: connect_four.py
        Features:
            Player vs. Player mode
            Player vs. AI mode using the Minimax algorithm
        Usage:
            Run the script: python connect_four.py
            Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

    Timer
        Description: This project is a simple timer application using the Tkinter library.
        Files: timer.py
        Features:
            Start, stop, and reset timer functionality
            User-friendly graphical interface
        Usage:
            Run the script: python timer.py
            Use the interface buttons to control the timer.

    Dithering
        Description: This project demonstrates two dithering algorithms (Threshold and Random Dithering) to generate images.
        Files: dithering.py
        Features:
            Apply Threshold Dithering to an image
            Apply Random Dithering to an image
            Display the original and dithered images using Tkinter
        Usage:
            Run the script: python dithering.py
            Select an image file to apply the dithering algorithms.

Getting Started

To run any of the projects, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you will need to install the Tkinter library if it is not already included in your Python installation.
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    Tkinter (usually included with standard Python installations)

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    sh

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository

Navigate to the directory of the project you want to run and execute the script:

sh

python connect_four.py

or

sh

python timer.py

or

sh

    python dithering.py

Note

These projects are educational and may contain mistakes. They were created as part of a learning process in our Programming 2 lecture.
