# ConnectFour
This repository contains three small projects developed as part of our Programming 2 lecture. These projects were intended to help us improve our Python skills and are subject to mistakes

## Projects Overview

 ### Connect Four 

**Description:** This project implements the famous Connect Four game. The game includes an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm to make decisions.                                                                                           

**Files:** connect_four.py                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

**Features:**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
           -Player vs. Player 2  
           -Random player
            -Player vs. AI mode using the Minimax algorithm       

            
 **Usage:**
            Run the script: python connect_four.py
            Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
            (The user had problems when running the script on VS code)! 

 ### Timer
  **Description:** This project is a simple timer application using the Tkinter library.                                         
  
  **Files:** clock.py



  
   **Features:**
            Start, stop, and reset timer functionality
            User-friendly graphical interface

            
   **Usage:**
            Run the script: python timer.py
            Use the interface buttons to control the timer.

 ### Dithering:
 
 **Description:** This project demonstrates two dithering algorithms (Threshold and Random Dithering) to generate images.   


 
 **Files:** dithering.py



 
 **Features:**
            Apply Threshold Dithering to an image
            Apply Random Dithering to an image
            Display the original and dithered images using Tkinter


            
 **Usage:**
            Run the script: python dithering.py
            Select an image file to apply the dithering algorithms.




## Getting Started

To run any of the projects, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you will need to install the Tkinter library if it is not already included in your Python installation.
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    Tkinter (usually included with standard Python installations)

Installation
Clone the repository:
    
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
     cd your-repository


Navigate to the directory of the project you want to run and execute the script:


python connect_four.py

or


python timer.py

or



  python dithering.py

## Hey, dont forget that...

These projects are educational and may contain mistakes and not very creative variable names. They were created as part of a learning process in our Programming 2 lecture.
